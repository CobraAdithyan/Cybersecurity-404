            <h1>What is Cybersecurity?</h1>
            <p>Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting digital information, networks, and systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. It is crucial in today's digital age to protect personal and sensitive information from being stolen or compromised[4).</p>

            <h1>Common Cyber Threats</h1>
            <p>There are several types of cyber threats that businesses face, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Malware:</strong> malicious software that can harm computers and mobile devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> a type of social engineering attack that tricks users into revealing sensitive information.</li>
                <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> a type of malware that encrypts files and demands a ransom in exchange for the decryption key.</li>
                <li><strong>SQL Injection:</strong> an attack where an attacker injects malicious SQL code into a web application's database to extract or modify sensitive data.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="best-practices">
            <h1>Best Practices for Improving Cybersecurity</h1>
            <h2>Train Employees in Security Principles</h2>
            <p>Establish basic security practices and policies for employees, such as requiring strong passwords and appropriate Internet use guidelines[3).</p>
            <h2>Protect Information, Computers, and Networks</h2>
            <p>Keep your machines clean by having the latest security software, web browser, and operating system. Ensure firewalls are enabled and configure them to protect your Internet connection[5).</p>
            <h2>Create a Mobile Device Action Plan</h2>
            <p>Require users to password-protect their devices, encrypt their data, and install security apps to prevent criminals from stealing information on public networks[1>.</p>
            <h2>Make Backup Copies of Important Data</h2>
            <p>Regularly backup critical data on all computers. Store the backups either offsite or in the cloud[1).</p>
            <h2>Control Physical Access</h2>
            <p>Prevent access or use of business computers by unauthorized individuals. Limit accounts with high-level privileges and clearly define account management processes[2).</p>
            <h2>Secure Your Wi-Fi Networks</h2>
            <p>Ensure your Wi-Fi network is secure, encrypted, and hidden. Set up your wireless access point or router so it does not broadcast the network name (SSID)[1).</p>
            <h2>Use Multi-Factor Authentication</h2>
            <pRequire employees to use unique passwords and change them every three months. Implement multi-factor authentication that requires additional information beyond a password[3).</p>
            <h2>Stay Up to Date</h2>
            <pEnsure all security patches and updates are applied as soon as they are released. Maintain a system inventory with baseline requirements[5).</p>
            <h2>Monitor Networks and Systems</h2>
            <pContinuously monitor networks and systems and analyze logs for suspicious activities. Develop an incident management/disaster recovery plan and test it regularly[4).</p>
